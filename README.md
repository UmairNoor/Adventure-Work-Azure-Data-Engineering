# Adventure-Work-Azure-Data-Engineering
🌟 Adventure Work Azure Data Engineering Project! 🚀

I recently completed an End-to-End Data Engineering Implementation for the AdventureWorks dataset using Microsoft Azure services. This project covered every phase of the data engineering lifecycle, from ingestion and transformation to analysis and visualization, delivering impactful business insights. 📊

✨ Key Highlights:

Data Ingestion: Automated data extraction from GitHub using Azure Data Factory, with parameterized pipelines for adaptability.

Data Transformation: Processed and cleaned raw data using Azure Databricks, leveraging PySpark and Apache Spark for efficiency.

Data Storage: Implemented a multi-layered data architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) in Azure Data Lake Gen2 for scalability and structured analysis.

Analytics and Visualization: Designed interactive reports in Power BI, showcasing insights like yearly sales trends and customer engagement growth.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:

Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, Power BI, Microsoft Entra ID
